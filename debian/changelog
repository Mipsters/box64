box64 (0.1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added an option to get generated -NAN on SSE2 operation
  * Many small fixes and improvement to get SteamPlay (i.e. proton) working (along with box86)
  * Added some workaround for program calling uname to mimic x86_64 system
  * Added some granularity to mmap, and generic memory protection tracking improvment, to mimic x86 system (for wine stagging and proton)
  * Better clone syscall and libc implementation
  * Improved wrapping of GTK libs
  * More wrapped libs (more gtk libs, like gstreamer-1.0 among other non-gtk libs too)
  * More wrapped functions(with some tricky one, like dladdr1)
  * Some fixes and improvment to some wrapped functions
  * Refactor Dynarec:
  *   - better handling of SSE/x87 registers
  *   - optimisation to limit float/double conversion
  *   - better handling of "internal" jump inside a dynablock
  *   - make adding new architecture easier, by sharing as much infrastructure as possible
  * Improved elfloader
  * Improved some tests
  * Improved a bit the "Hotpage" handling and messages
  * Added more dynarec opcodes
  * A few fixes in some Dynarec opcodes
  * A bit more optimisation in some Dynarec opcodes
  * Don't quit on unsupported syscall, return -1 / ENOSYS error
  * Added some more Syscall
  * Wrapped Vulkan library. Vulkan and dxvk now supported!
  * Support building on PPC64LE (interpretor only)
  * Added support for Risc-V (interpretor only)
